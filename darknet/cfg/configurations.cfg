In this folder, there are configuration files to use darknet.

In your configuration file:

1) filters PARAMETER:
filters has to be equal to: 
(classes+coordinates+1)*masks. 
As a reference, for COCO dataset this value is equal to:
(80+4+1)*3

As an example I had 1 class to detect (which is car class), and therefore I have used:

filters = (1+4+1)*3

since I haven't changed much in yolov3's original config file.

2) max_batches PARAMETER:

max_batches = classes*2000  --it shouldn't be less than 4000. Therefore I have used 4000.

max_batches is equal to total number of iterations per epoch.

3) steps PARAMETER:

steps = 80% of max_batches, 90% of ma_batches

steps is equal to number of iterations after which learning rate will be multiplied by scales factor. scales parameter is also in cfg file.
I have used steps = 3200, 3600 since I have max_batches = 4000

4) batch PARAMETER:

batch is equal to images processed in one batch during iteration. This number tend to change from computer to computer because of the variations in capacity.
One must try to find the ideal number. More explanation exists below 5th parameter.

5) subdivisions PARAMETER:

subdivisions parameter is equal to the number of mini batches in one batch. In other words, it is the number of batches that GPU processes in once.

It is possible to think mini batch = batch/subdivisions. Which means every time your GPU has to process this many mini batches. Thus, it's possible this process could not be done by your GPU if it's not powerful enough.

At Ubuntu 22.0.4, the error I get when this process needed to use more memory than I have was
"Killed".
When encountered with this error, you have to choose smaller numbers for batch or bigger numbers for subdivisions. 
Keep in mind that they are 2*x kind of numbers.
As an example:

A possible usage: batch = 64, subdivisions = 16
Another: batch = 1, subdivisions = 1   -which we use for test.cfg file-
Another: batch = 16, subdivisions = 8
