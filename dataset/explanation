In this folder, we have our dataset. 

1)create_train.py

For convenience I have placed create_train.py here. This python script is expected to create our trained.txt and test.txt files.

We will use them when training our model.

Further explanation exists in create_train.py script.

2)data_name.py

With this script, you will be able to create your labeled.data and classes.name files. 

labeled.data: labeled.data file is later carried to darknet/cfg folder to use in training.

classes.names: .name files consist of names of your classes. If further explanation is being needed, check out darknet/data .names files. 

Also, more explanation included in data_name.py script.
